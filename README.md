Project Outline:
Polls is the Connecting Silo application. The Connecting Silo project is built based on  Professor Gerald Q. Maguire Jr's toolbox. The source code for the toolbox can be found in KTH internal github. bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA is a tool that can batch convert mods generated from Connecting Silo(polls folder) into bibtex. bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA is developed based on Professor Maguire's toolbox. [1] 

Polls:
Process Module: src/parse/kth_extract
Canvas RestAPI Operation: src/Canvas
DiVA Operation: src/Diva
KTH API:er : src/KTH
Output Data: output

bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA:
Main class:xml2bib_loop.py
The rest of the class and method information can be found under professor Maguire's gitHub repositiory: https://github.com/gqmaguirejr/bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA [1] 

Install project requisition:
run './install_requisition.sh'
project is using python pip3,pip,conda,selenium, lxml and geckodriver for firefox
Project is built upon Django framework
The user needs to configure config.json under 'polls/src/Canvas/canvas' and KTHconfig.json under 'polls/src/KTH' for the program to execute properly.
Under config.json, user neesd to input oauth token and the address of the Canvas server.

General start up:
bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA:
python xml2bib_loop.py 'path of the output folder'
For this project the 'path of the output folder' is '../polls/output/parse_result' Polls:
The data in the thesis report is partially automated with module: test_accuracy.py 

Note:
Thesis: document_type = 0
Proporsal: document_type = 1

The project is intended to simplify KTH - Royal Institute of Technology Sweden use of Canvas LMS. In order to reuse this implementation for another institute, modification to some settings may be required.
